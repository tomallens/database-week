# Two Tables (Many-to-Many) Design Recipe Template

_Copy this recipe template to design and create two related database tables having a Many-to-Many relationship._

## 1. Extract nouns from the user stories or specification

```
# EXAMPLE USER STORIES:

As a blogger,
So I can organise my blog posts,
I want to keep a list of posts with their title and content.

As a blogger,
So I can organise my blog posts,
I want to keep a list of tags with their name (e.g 'coding' or 'travel').

As a blogger,
So I can organise my blog posts,
I want to be able to assign one tag to different posts.

As a blogger,
So I can organise my blog posts,
I want to be able to tag one post with one or different many tags.
```

```
Nouns:

posts, title, tags, name
```

## 2. Infer the Table Name and Columns

Put the different nouns in this table. Replace the example with your own nouns.

| Record                | Properties          |
| --------------------- | ------------------  |
| posts                 | title, content
| tags                  | name

1. Name of the first table (always plural): `posts` 

    Column names: `title`, `content`

2. Name of the second table (always plural): `tags` 

    Column names: `name`

## 3. Decide the column types.

[Here's a full documentation of PostgreSQL data types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html).

Most of the time, you'll need either `text`, `int`, `bigint`, `numeric`, or `boolean`. If you're in doubt, do some research or ask your peers.

Remember to **always** have the primary key `id` as a first column. Its type will always be `SERIAL`.

```
# EXAMPLE:

Table: posts
id: SERIAL
title: text
content: text

Table: tags
id: SERIAL
name: text
```

## 4. Design the Many-to-Many relationship

Make sure you can answer YES to these two questions:

1. Can one [TABLE ONE] have many [TABLE TWO]? (Yes/No)
2. Can one [TABLE TWO] have many [TABLE ONE]? (Yes/No)

```
# EXAMPLE

1. Can one tag have many posts? YES
2. Can one post have many tags? YES
```

_If you would answer "No" to one of these questions, you'll probably have to implement a One-to-Many relationship, which is simpler. Use the relevant design recipe in that case._

## 5. Design the Join Table

The join table usually contains two columns, which are two foreign keys, each one linking to a record in the two other tables.

The naming convention is `table1_table2`.

```
# EXAMPLE

Join table for tables: posts and tags
Join table name: posts_tags
Columns: post_id, tag_id
```

## 4. Write the SQL.

```sql
-- EXAMPLE
-- file: posts_tags.sql

-- Replace the table name, columm names and types.

-- Create the first table.
CREATE TABLE posts (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title text,
  content text
);

-- Create the second table.
CREATE TABLE tags (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name text
);

-- Create the join table.
CREATE TABLE posts_tags (
  post_id int,
  tag_id int,
  constraint fk_post foreign key(post_id) references posts(id) on delete cascade,
  constraint fk_tag foreign key(tag_id) references tags(id) on delete cascade,
  PRIMARY KEY (post_id, tag_id)
);

```

## 5. Create the tables.

```bash
psql -h 127.0.0.1 database_name < posts_tags.sql
```

# {{TABLE NAME}} Model and Repository Classes Design Recipe

_Copy this recipe template to design and implement Model and Repository classes for a database table._

## 1. Design and create the Table

If the table is already created in the database, you can skip this step.

Otherwise, [follow this recipe to design and create the SQL schema for your table](./single_table_design_recipe_template.md).

*In this template, we'll use an example table `posts`*

```
# EXAMPLE

Table: posts

Columns:
id | name | cohort_name
```

## 2. Create Test SQL seeds

Your tests will depend on data stored in PostgreSQL to run.

If seed data is provided (or you already created it), you can skip this step.

```sql

(file: spec/seeds_posts.sql)

-- Write your SQL seed here. 

-- First, you'd need to truncate the table - this is so our table is emptied between each test run,
-- so we can start with a fresh state.
-- (RESTART IDENTITY resets the primary key)

TRUNCATE TABLE tags RESTART IDENTITY; -- replace with your own table name.

-- Below this line there should only be `INSERT` statements.
-- Replace these statements with your own seed data.

INSERT INTO tags (name) VALUES ('animal');
INSERT INTO tags (name) VALUES ('cute');
```

Run this SQL file on the database to truncate (empty) the table, and insert the seed data. Be mindful of the fact any existing records in the table will be deleted.

```bash
psql -h 127.0.0.1 blog_test < seeds_tags.sql
```
```sql

(file: spec/seeds_posts.sql)

-- Write your SQL seed here. 

-- First, you'd need to truncate the table - this is so our table is emptied between each test run,
-- so we can start with a fresh state.
-- (RESTART IDENTITY resets the primary key)

TRUNCATE TABLE posts RESTART IDENTITY; -- replace with your own table name.

-- Below this line there should only be `INSERT` statements.
-- Replace these statements with your own seed data.

INSERT INTO posts (title) VALUES ('dogs');
INSERT INTO posts (title) VALUES ('cats');
```

Run this SQL file on the database to truncate (empty) the table, and insert the seed data. Be mindful of the fact any existing records in the table will be deleted.

```bash
psql -h 127.0.0.1 your_database_name < seeds_posts.sql
```

```sql

TRUNCATE TABLE posts_tags RESTART IDENTITY; -- replace with your own table name.

-- Below this line there should only be `INSERT` statements.
-- Replace these statements with your own seed data.

INSERT INTO posts_tags (post_id, tag_id) VALUES ('1', '1');
INSERT INTO posts_tags (post_id, tag_id) VALUES ('2', '2');
```
```bash
psql -h 127.0.0.1 blog_test < seeds_posts_tags.sql
```
Run this SQL file on the database to truncate (empty) the table, and insert the seed data. Be mindful of the fact any existing records in the table will be deleted.

```bash
psql -h 127.0.0.1 your_database_name < seeds_posts.sql
```

## 3. Define the class names

Usually, the Model class name will be the capitalised table name (single instead of plural). The same name is then suffixed by `Repository` for the Repository class name.

```ruby
# Table name: Posts

# Model class
# (in lib/post.rb)
class Post
end

# Model class
# (in lib/tag.rb)
class Tag
end

# Repository class
# (in lib/post_repository.rb)
class PostRepository
end
```

## 4. Implement the Model class

Define the attributes of your Model class. You can usually map the table columns to the attributes of the class, including primary and foreign keys.

```ruby
# EXAMPLE
# Table name: posts

# Model class
# (in lib/student.rb)

class Post

  # Replace the attributes by your own columns.
  attr_accessor :id, :title
end

class Tag

  # Replace the attributes by your own columns.
  attr_accessor :id, :name
end

# The keyword attr_accessor is a special Ruby feature
# which allows us to set and get attributes on an object,
# here's an example:
#
# student = Student.new
# student.name = 'Jo'
# student.name
```

*You may choose to test-drive this class, but unless it contains any more logic than the example above, it is probably not needed.*

## 5. Define the Repository Class interface

Your Repository class will need to implement methods for each "read" or "write" operation you'd like to run against the database.

Using comments, define the method signatures (arguments and return value) and what they do - write up the SQL queries that will be used by each method.

```ruby

# Table name: posts

# Repository class
# (in lib/post_repository.rb)

class PostRepository
  def find_by_tag(id)
    # Executes the SQL query:
    SELECT posts.id,
          posts.title
          FROM posts
          JOIN posts_tags ON posts_tags.post_id = posts.id
          JOIN tags ON posts_tags.tag_id = tags.id
          WHERE tags.id = $1
          ;

    # Returns a single Post object.
  end
end
```

## 6. Write Test Examples

Write Ruby code that defines the expected behaviour of the Repository class, following your design from the table written in step 5.

These examples will later be encoded as RSpec tests.

```ruby
# EXAMPLES

# get all posts by tag

repo = PostRepository.new

posts = repo.find_by_tag(1)

posts.length # =>  1

posts[0].id # =>  1
posts[0].title # =>  'dogs'


# Add more examples for each method
```

Encode this example as a test.

## 7. Reload the SQL seeds before each test run

Running the SQL code present in the seed file will empty the table and re-insert the seed data.

This is so you get a fresh table contents every time you run the test suite.

```ruby
# EXAMPLE

# file: spec/student_repository_spec.rb

def reset_students_table
  seed_sql = File.read('spec/seeds_students.sql')
  connection = PG.connect({ host: '127.0.0.1', dbname: 'posts' })
  connection.exec(seed_sql)
end

describe StudentRepository do
  before(:each) do 
    reset_students_table
  end

  # (your tests will go here).
end
```

## 8. Test-drive and implement the Repository class behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._
